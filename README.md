# NanoBioTools
A set of tools for analyzing nano-bio interfaces.

Currently implemented/almost completed:
- calculation of surface-atom distances based on MDtraj library
- building of surface-atom number density profiles
- calculation of residence time of adsorbed molecules

Planned features:
- calculation of order parameters in lipid bilayers
- calculation of lateral diffusion in lipid bilayers
